# StudentGradeManager
The option comes from HikVision online examination. Although this topic is not for me, it is very suitable to practice and get familiar with the OOP idea of C++.

The main function is to realize a system, including a kind of class to store student name, number and major and an inherited class which is like a interface to provide student's average grade of its all course.
